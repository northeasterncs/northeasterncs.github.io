                Telehealth involves the use of electronic communications to enable Northeastern Counseling Services clinicians to connect with individuals using live
                interactive video and audio communications. Telehealth includes the practice of psychological health care delivery, diagnosis, consultation, treatment,
                referral to resources, education, and the transfer of medical and clinical data.
              </p>
              <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                <li>
                  I will be receiving mental health services through interactive videoconferencing. I understand the use of videoconferencing is an alternative method
                  of mental health care delivery and that my therapist will not be physically in the same room with me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I understand that although Northeastern Counseling Services makes every effort to protect my privacy by using the Doxy.me secure platform, they cannot
                  guarantee the security of any information I transmit to them over the Internet. By using telehealth services, I recognize that transmissions over the
                  Internet are at my own risk and that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access the transmissions. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  I also understand that despite reasonable efforts on the part of my therapist, there are risks and consequences in using telehealth services. The risks
                  include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the transmission of sessions could be disrupted or distorted by technical failures. In case of
                  technical failures, my therapist will make every effort to re-connect with me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I also understand that telehealth services may not be as complete as services provided via face-to-face, although, several benefits of telehealth
                  services have been identified including increased access to specialized services in remote areas, lower healthcare costs, reduced travel, minimizing
                  time off work, and decreased waiting time for services. I have also been notified that if my therapist believes I would be better served by another
                  form of counseling services (e.g., face-to-face services), I will be referred to a therapist who can provide such services. Finally, I understand that
                  there are potential risks and benefits associated with any form of mental health service and that, despite my efforts and the efforts of my therapist,
                  my condition may not improve and in some cases may even get worse. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  I understand that my participation in this is voluntary and I may decide to terminate my treatment at any time.                
                </li>
                <li>
                  My privacy and confidentiality will be protected. I understand that there will be no recordings of my therapy sessions. I also agree to not record my
                  own therapy sessions without my therapist's knowledge or permission.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Northeastern Counseling Services will bill insurance for telehealth services when these services have been determined to be covered by an individualâ€™s
                  insurance plan. The standard copay and/or deductibles would apply. In the event that my insurance does not cover telehealth, or I do not have 
                  insurance, I have the option to pay out-of-pocket.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>            
                By clicking "Agree" below, I acknowledge I have read, understand and agree with the contents of this Telehealth Informed Consent agreement and give 
                my consent to use teletherapy. I have also discussed any concerns with my therapist, and all of my questions have been answered to my satisfaction.

        <h2>What is teletherapy?</h2>
        <p>
          Teletherapy is a form of telehealth or telemedicine used to provide real-time, behaviorial healthcare through the use of telecommunications technology.
        </p>
        <h2>How is teletherapy delivered?</h2>
        <p>
          We use a mix of secured communications (video, audio and text) on computers, tablets and phones to deliver the best possible experience, 
          while maintaining the privacy of our clients and compliance with all healthcare regulations.
        </p>
        <h2>What platforms do you use for video-based, teletherapy sessions?</h2>
        <p>
          All of our teletherapy video sessions are conducted via HIPAA compliant platforms such as <a href="doxy.me">Doxy.me</a> and
          <a href="https://virtualtherapyconnect.com/">Virtual Therapy Connect</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Where can teletherapy be used?</h2>
        <p>
          Teletherapy can be used by clinicians and clients from anywhere a connection to the Internet is available. For the best experience we recommend a
          private environment which is free from distractions.
        </p>
        <h2>Is teletherapy covered by my insurance?</h2>
        <p>
          As of March 16, 2020, teletherapy is now covered by most commercial insurance companies. Please contact your carrier to confirm your benefits.
        </p>
        <h2>Anything else I need to know?</h2>
        <p>
          Clients will be asked to complete a telehealth consent form before beginning the first session. We will be happy to address any other
          questions or concerns you might have regarding the telehealth process.
